# Self-supervised learning


## Goal of the project

This project aims to explore different pre-training strategies, focusing on self pre-training and transfer learning, and to compare two deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our investigation revolves around the use of autoencoders and pre-trained models like ResNet18, with a specific focus on image classification tasks.

In addition to the above tasks, the project also includes exploring autoencoders using the MNIST dataset to understand their capabilities in image reconstruction, both with and without noise interference.
